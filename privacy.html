<h1>Privacy Policy for 2048</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: January 17, 2026</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how 2048 ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

<p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> 2048 is a simple puzzle sliding game. No registration, no login, no personal identifiable information (PII) is required or collected. This includes no collection of names, emails, IP addresses, device IDs, location, usage analytics, or any other user-specific data.</p>

<h2>Solana Blockchain Features (if applicable)</h2>
<p>If the App includes optional Solana wallet connection or on-chain interactions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All blockchain actions are user-initiated and processed directly on the Solana network.</li>
    <li>We do not access, store, collect, or process your private keys, seed phrases, wallet addresses, transaction details, or any sensitive wallet information.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet and any on-chain activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking tools, or services (e.g., no Google Analytics, no Mouseflow, no cookies). No data is shared with third parties.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our App is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will delete it immediately.</p>
